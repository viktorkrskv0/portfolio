* gauss_integration - performs numerical integration using the Gauss method
* interpolation_analysis - performs one dimensional interpolation analysis
* multidimensional_interpolation - performs multidimensional interpolation analysis
* random_number_generator - generates random numbers
* simplex - using the simplex algorithm to find an extermum in a multidimensional function
* monte_carlo_integration - using the monte carlo method to integrate three dimensional function


#### Python

* Workshop in Data science - a collection of scripts & a Jupyter Notebook that were used for feature engineering, gathering data from Google's geocoding API and finally predicting housing prices
